          >here</a
        >
        in greater detail. Tab order is important to allow for non-keyboard and

      </p>
      <h3>WCAG2/WAI</h3>
      <p>
        WCAG2 is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines which defines how to
        make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including
        visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and
        neurological disabilities. WAI is the Web Accessibility Initiative by
        the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which is an effort to improve the

        pages. This also is true for non-visually impaired users in poor
        lighting conditions such as direct sunlight on a phone screen. Many
        frameworks provide accessibility and color contrasting features built
        in.

        product. This process generally is iterative in nature and has
        stakeholders and users conduct A/B testing of designs along with provide

        often task oriented.

        simple conceptually in that a link from or to a credible and relevant
        source provides validation and importance to your website.
