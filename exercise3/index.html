      <h3>Date</h3>
      <p>
        The JavaScript Date() object for the current date and time according to
        operating system settings as no arguments are being passed. Writing
        directly to the DOM like I am doing in this example isn't ideal as it
        has the potential to re-render the DOM and it slow rendering of the
        page.

      <h3>Popup</h3>
      <p>
        The final project will likely have a call-to-action in the form of a
        popup (modal) that announces a sale price or newsletter. These are often
        used to capture customers either via a direct sale or for follow up
        media/content.

      <pre>
const modal = document.getElementById('myModal')
const span = document.getElementsByClassName('close')[0]

window.setTimeout(() => {
  modal.style.display = 'block'
}, 1000)

span.onclick = function() {
  modal.style.display = 'none'

      <h2 id="links">SEO - Links</h2>
      <p>
        When building links into a website they should be used to provide
        amplifying information, navigate to subcategories, to a third party,
        etc. Depending on the type of website and the audience the types of
        links are important too such as opening a new tab or navigating the
        current tab. For example, a link that provides a free e-book download
        shouldn't replace the current website tab as the user may end up leaving
        the website early. Often these types of links are parts of the overall
        sales funnel or user experience.
      </p>
      <p>Some general tips when building links are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A link should be able stand alone</li>
        <li>Links should be descriptive</li>
        <li>A link should start with a relevant keyword</li>
        <li>Links should be unique</li>
        <li>Plain text links should stick to the underlined text convention</li>
        <li>
          A link should be SEO friendly by being relevant to the target page
        </li>
        <li>A link shouldn't be overly keyword heavy</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="xml">SEO - XML</h2>
      <p>
        Web search engines routinely go through and index all website pages they
        can access. One way they do this is by "poking" around the web and
        following pages. One way to think of this is through an analogy of a
        spider crawling through a maze. Sometimes if the spider doesn't
        understand the content/pages it visits it will fail to index it
        properly. For a website, this could mean it never reads your blog or the
        awesome video you've uploaded. One of the ways to work around this
        limitation of the search engines is to provide a map called a sitemap.
        This website has a
        <a href="../exercise1/sitemap.xml" target="_blank">sitemap</a>.

    <div id="myModal" class="modal">
      <div class="modal-content">
        <span class="close">&times;</span>
        <h1>JavaScript Timed Popup</h1>
        <p>
          This modal potentially will be used to showcase a sale or signing up
          to a newsletter, etc.

          Clicking the X in the upper right hand corner will close it.
